  This test verifies that the discovery info is properly serialized and deserialized by a backup server.
  This server is created twice by running twice the test_11_BACKUP_server.xml file:
    - The first time the discovery data is serialized to a backup file.
    - Then this server crashes but the backup file prevails.
    - The second time the discovery data is deserialized from the backup file because the leaseDuration
    doesn't allow the clients to detect server's demise.
